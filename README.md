#Calculator
==========



Hello! this was a little project I created on a trip from New Orleans to Nashville, Tn!

This is just a little Calculator App I created from scratch using nodejs, very simple and accurate!
The way it works is first:
- It prompts the use what would the use like to use? (D)ivision?
- (M)ultiplication
- (A)ddition
- (S)ubtraction
- or (Q)uit to end the application

===========

I used If/Else statements to Determine wheather the person was using addision or division, and the numbers were converted to intergers and stored in an Array to keep the numbers stored and used the Array to function the output to the user, say what numbers were used and then the anser the user is looking for!

Thanks for reading!
