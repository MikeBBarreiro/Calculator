#Calculator
==========



Hello! this was a little project I created on a trip from New Orleans to Nashville, Tn!

This is just a little Calculator App I created from scratch using nodejs, very simple and accurate!
The way it works is first:
- It prompts the user if he or she would like to use? (D)ivision?
- (M)ultiplication
- (A)ddition
- (S)ubtraction
- or (Q)uit to end the application

===========

I used If/Else statements to Determine wheather the person was using addition or division. The numbers were converted to intergers and put in an Array to keep the numbers stored useing the array to function the output to the user, telling what numbers were used and the answer the user is looking for! 
Using a while loop, the app will continue to ask if the user would like to continue or type (q) to quit.
Sense the array stores any numbers pushed to it, I used a __.shift( );__ to clear the array for when the user uses the options again making the array give the correct numbers listed to the user!

Thanks for reading!
